        The universe is all of space and time and their contents, including
        planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. The
        Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the
        development of the universe. According to this theory, space and time
        emerged together 13.787Â±0.020 billion years ago, and the universe has
        been expanding ever since the Big Bang. While the spatial size of the
        entire universe is unknown, it is possible to measure the size of the
        observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in
        diameter at the present day.
