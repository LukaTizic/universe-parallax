        There is no air or atmosphere in space. Since it is a vacuum, sound
        waves will have no medium to travel to. That means, no one will hear you
        scream in space, even if you shout the loudest! While sound waves
        (mechanical waves) need a medium to travel, radio waves (electromagnetic
        waves) can travel in the void of space. Astronauts use radios to stay in
        communication while in space since radio waves can still be sent and
        received in a vacuum environment.
