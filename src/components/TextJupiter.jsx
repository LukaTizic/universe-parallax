        Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, is composed of hydrogen
        and helium. These are the same elements that our Sun is made up of.
        However, Jupiter is not large enough to start nuclear fusion and
        generate its own energy. If it were around 80 times bigger, it would
        become a star with low mass. Another fun fact about Jupiter is that it
        has a storm called the Great Red Spot. It has been swirling for more
        than a hundred years.
