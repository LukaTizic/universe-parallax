        There will be no more total solar eclipses in about 600 million years,
        scientists say. Because of the moon's slowly increasing orbit, NASA
        believes the moon will have moved far enough away from Earth in that
        timeframe that it will no longer be big enough to entirely cover the
        sun. “It will be too small in the sky,” said Dr. C. Alex Young, the
        associate director for science in the heliophysics science division at
        NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The moon's orbit is increasing by
        about 1.5 inches each year, Young added. The sun is also expected to
        expand slightly in the future but NASA has not yet seen a noticeable
        change, Young said. Partial eclipses will still exist in 600 million
        years
